## Instructions to Test the Profile Edit Page

### Step 1: Login as a Company User
1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/superuser/login
2. Use these credentials:
   - **Username:** `testcompany1`
   - **Password:** `password123`

### Step 2: Access Profile Edit
1. After login, go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/superuser/profile/edit
2. Or click "Manage Profile" from the dropdown menu

### Step 3: What You Should See
- A clean, modern profile edit form with:
  - Company logo upload section
  - Company name field (required)
  - Email field (required)
  - Phone field
  - Website field
  - Address field
  - Company description field

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**If you get redirected to login:**
- Make sure you're logged in as a company user (role_id = 2)
- Check that the username/password is correct

**If you see an error:**
- Check that all required database migrations have run
- Ensure the Users model has all fillable fields

**If styling looks broken:**
- The page now uses inline CSS for better compatibility
- Bootstrap should load from CDN

### Alternative Test Users:
If testcompany1 doesn't work, try:
- **Username:** `testcompany2`
- **Password:** `password123`

The profile edit page has been completely rewritten with:
✅ Better error handling
✅ File upload for logos
✅ Improved validation
✅ Modern responsive design
✅ Proper form structure
